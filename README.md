# Notes for `React Redux TODO App`

a TODO List application, in React, which users can use to add, view and delete TODO items (called “TODOs”). Example TODOs in the list might be:

·        Wash the car

·        Mow the lawn

·        Do the washing-up

>When starting the application, the list should be empty. There should be a form for adding new TODOs, somewhere to view all TODOs, and a way to tick off (i.e. remove) TODOs.<br/><br/>This project is intended to be a way for you to demonstrate your coding abilities, and your ability to create user interfaces. The code and the UI do not need to be complicated, and this should take under 3 hours. If you can, please use TypeScript. Similarly, if you can, use Redux to store the TODOs.<br/><br/>If you want to, you can use Create React App to set up your application. For this project, we will be primarily looking at and discussing the React components that you create, rather than the configuration files (i.e. Webpack or similar).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
